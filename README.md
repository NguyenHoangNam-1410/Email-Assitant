## Security & Privacy

- No Data Storage: The extension doesn't store or log your email content
- Secure Communication: Uses localhost API calls to your own backend
- Minimal Permissions: Only requests necessary Gmail access permissions

---

## Troubleshooting
### Extension Issues:

- Button not appearing: Refresh Gmail and ensure the extension is enabled
- "Generation failed" error: Check that your backend is running on http://localhost:8080
- Content not replacing: Try clicking in the compose box first, then click AI Update

### Backend Issues:

- API errors: Ensure your AI service configuration is correct
- CORS issues: Backend includes CORS configuration for localhost origins
